How GitHub Actions builds HitoVox (Windows):

- The workflow checks out the repo with submodules.
- It expects JUCE to be available at ./JUCE (submodule).
- It configures CMake with Visual Studio 2022 and builds Release.
- NSIS is installed via Chocolatey on the runner and used to make the installer.
- Artifacts (the .vst3 and HitoVox-Installer.exe) are uploaded to the workflow run.

If you want me to push this repo to your GitHub account and trigger the workflow, I can prepare the final ZIP for upload and guide you step-by-step.
